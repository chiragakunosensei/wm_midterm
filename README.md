Midterm

The midterm will be released in class on the week of 3/8

It will be due by the start of the class the following week. 

You may use any resources you choose with the exception of asking help from another human being 

You will evaluated in the following way...

All grades are contingent on your ability to explain the code you wrote to me during the class after the midterm is due...

If you do not get an A you also must make corrections. You will have a week (And help) to work on corrections)

A = 4 correct solutions. Programs are efficient and created in ways we have practiced in class/ consistent with what I have asked for in the prompt.

A- = You get 4 correct solutions but the code is inefficient, way too long, or not consistent with what I have asked for.

B+ = 3 correct and 1 wrong 

B = 2 right - 2 wrong minor errors prevent you from getting correct response 

B- = 2 correct and 2 wrong 

C + = 1 Correct and 3 wrong minor errors prevent you from getting correct response

C = 1 Correct and 3 wrong

C- = All wrong, but you showed mastery of concepts in attempting the problems

D = Major misunderstandings in all questions.

*** You will complete 4 questions in total

*** Everyone is required to finish numbers 1 and 2 

*** You must pick 2 out of 3 for questions 4,5, and 6


Required: Question 1: Create a Map of Farmers Markets in Philly https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/farmers-markets-locations that only has markers in the 'neighborhood' Location of 'Center City' console.log the data to find where this information exists. 

Required: Question 2: Make a proportional symbol of world populations using 'populated places,' (not populated places simple) on geojson.xyz.
 
    a. The map should have appropriate shaped/sized circles - create a function to do the lifting 
    b. Your circles should have no 'stroke'
    c. Create a popup for all the circles that gives the Name and Population. There are several population categories - be explicit about which one you choose (I don't care which one, just make sure you let the user know someplace on the map)
    d. When the user mousesovers a circle give it 'stroke'. The circles should go back to their 'strokeless state' when the user mouses out of a cricle.
    e. There should be a title and footer explaining how the map works.


Choose 2 out of 3...

Question 3: The Marker Game (see .html)
